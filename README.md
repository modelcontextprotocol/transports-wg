# MCP Transports Working Group

Welcome to the **MCP Transports Working Group** — a collaborative community focused on improving the usability of transports in the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io), including scalability, reliability, and semantics.

## Mission

The Transports Working Group coordinates community stakeholders to:

- **Improve transport usability** across MCP implementations
- **Define scalability patterns** for connection pooling, load distribution, and resource management
- **Establish reliability standards** for error handling, reconnection, and message delivery guarantees
- **Clarify transport semantics** for protocol behavior, message ordering, and state management
- **Drive interoperability** across platforms and implementations

> **See the [CHARTER](./CHARTER.md) for detailed scope and processes.**
