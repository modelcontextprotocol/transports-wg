## Abstract

This SEP defines a transport-agnostic mechanism for clients to express a
language preference on every MCP request, and for servers to indicate the
language actually used in every response. Preferences are carried in `_meta`
using a single field whose value is a [BCP 47] language-range list with the
exact syntax of the HTTP [`Accept-Language`][rfc9110-accept-language] field
(including quality values). For the Streamable HTTP transport, the value is
additionally mirrored into the standard `Accept-Language` / `Content-Language`
HTTP headers, following the precedent set by [SEP-2243] for `Mcp-Method` and
`Mcp-Name`. The proposal is deliberately narrow: it standardizes only language
negotiation, reuses an existing IETF mechanism unchanged, and avoids any
session state. Because the field is sent on every request, a user may change
the preferred language at any point during a conversation without
renegotiation, aligning with the stateless-by-default direction established
by [SEP-2575].

## Motivation

MCP exposes user-facing strings on tools, resources, prompts, and server
metadata (`title`, `description`, `text` content blocks, error messages, etc.)
that are intended for display in user interfaces. The specification today
provides no mechanism for a client to request these strings in a particular
language, or for a server that supports multiple languages to advertise which
one it returned. This forces ad-hoc solutions and discourages MCP servers
from investing in i18n at all.

### Primary goal: leverage existing ecosystem; do not reinvent the wheel

The single most important design constraint for this SEP is that MCP **must
not** invent new i18n machinery. Language negotiation is one of the
oldest, most thoroughly-solved problems on the web, and the solutions are
already in the hands of every server author:

- **Standards already exist**, [BCP 47] language tags, [RFC 4647]
  language-range matching (lookup and filtering), and the HTTP
  [`Accept-Language`][rfc9110-accept-language] /
  [`Content-Language`](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc9110.html#field.content-language)
  fields are stable, widely-understood IETF specifications. No bespoke
  syntax, matching rules, or fallback semantics need to be defined here.
- **Libraries already exist**, every major ecosystem ships a battle-tested
  matcher: `Intl.LocaleMatcher` and `Negotiator` in JavaScript,
  `golang.org/x/text/language`, Python `Babel` and `langcodes`, Java/ICU
  `ULocale.acceptLanguage`, Ruby's `Rack::Utils.q_values`, .NET
  `MicrosoftExtensions.Localization`, and so on. By accepting the
  `Accept-Language` syntax verbatim (quality values and all), server
  authors hand the string straight to a matcher they already trust.
- **Infrastructure already exists**, CDNs, caches, reverse proxies, WAFs
  and observability tools already understand `Accept-Language`,
  `Content-Language`, and `Vary: Accept-Language`. Mirroring the field
  into the HTTP layer means an MCP server fronted by Cloudflare, Fastly,
  nginx, Envoy or an API gateway gets per-language caching, routing and
  segmentation for free, no MCP-specific configuration required.
- **Translation tooling already exists**, gettext catalogs, ICU
  MessageFormat, Fluent, Crowdin/Lokalise/Transifex pipelines, and every
  framework-level i18n module (Rails I18n, ASP.NET resx, Django
  `gettext`, `i18next`, etc.) are keyed by BCP 47 tags. A server can
  plug its existing translation pipeline into MCP without writing a
  single line of new mapping code.

A previous attempt to address this ([PR #2355]) proposed adding guidance to
the Streamable HTTP transport recommending the use of standard HTTP
`Accept-Language` / `Content-Language` headers. That approach was correct in
spirit but received reasonable pushback from maintainers ([@pja-ant],
[@kurtisvg]) on two grounds:

1. **Transport parity.** A header-only solution leaves stdio (and any future
   non-HTTP transport) without an i18n mechanism, fragmenting the developer
   experience. [SEP-2575] explicitly requires that "stateless principles are
   applied consistently across all transports … allowing the core protocol
   semantics to be learned once and applied everywhere."
2. **Established mirroring pattern.** [SEP-2243] has since established the
   pattern of mirroring routing-relevant fields between the JSON-RPC payload
   and HTTP headers (with strict consistency requirements). Language
   preference belongs to the same category: it is metadata that
   intermediaries (CDNs, caches, gateways), the transport, and the
   application all benefit from seeing.

This SEP resolves both concerns by defining the language preference as a
first-class, transport-agnostic field in `_meta` and, on HTTP, requiring it
to mirror the existing standard headers, gaining stdio support, header
visibility, and stateless per-turn re-negotiation in one move, while
preserving the "lean into HTTP for what it already does well" approach that
has guided MCP's authorization story.

### Scope: which fields are eligible for translation

The mechanism itself is entirely optional (see the note at the start of
[Specification](#specification)). When a server **does** choose to honor
`acceptLanguage`, the rules below define exactly which fields it may
translate. The classification follows the schema's own framing of each
field: where a doc-comment says "intended for UI" or "human-readable
title", the field is display-only; where it says "hint to the model" or
"improve the LLM's understanding", the field is model-facing.

#### MUST translate

These fields are classified by the schema as display-only. A server
honoring `acceptLanguage` **MUST** localize them when a localized form
is available.

- `BaseMetadata.title` on every type that extends it: `Tool`, `Resource`,
  `ResourceTemplate`, `Prompt`, `PromptArgument`, `Implementation`,
  `PromptReference`.
- `ToolAnnotations.title`.
- `ElicitRequestFormParams.message` and `ElicitRequestURLParams.message`.
- In `ElicitRequestFormParams.requestedSchema`, the `title` and
  `description` of each property. Elicitation schemas are rendered as
  forms in the client; the model does not consume them.
- `ProgressNotification.message`.
- `JSONRPCError.message` when intended for user display (see the
  *Localized errors* subsection of [Specification](#specification) for
  how to opt in).

#### MAY translate, with explicit caveat

These fields are either explicitly model-facing in the schema or
dual-purpose (model and human). Servers **MAY** translate them, but
**MUST** be aware that doing so changes what the language model sees and
can affect tool-selection, planning, and other agent behavior. Real
agent implementations wire these fields directly into the model prompt:
for example, the open-source Codex agent passes `Tool.description`
unmodified into the OpenAI Responses API tool definition, and includes
both `title` and `description` in its tool-search index. Servers SHOULD
ensure translations preserve the technical meaning faithfully, and
SHOULD test agent behavior against translated catalogues.

- `Tool.description`, `Resource.description`,
  `ResourceTemplate.description`. The schema explicitly describes these
  as a "hint to the model".
- `Prompt.description`, `PromptArgument.description`,
  `Implementation.description`. The schema describes these as
  human-readable context; in practice hosts surface them to both users
  and models.
- Property-level `title` and `description` inside `Tool.inputSchema` and
  `Tool.outputSchema`. These appear inside the function definition the
  model receives via standard function-calling APIs, and some hosts also
  render them in parameter-confirmation UIs.
- Body content of `tools/call`, `resources/read`, and `prompts/get`.
  This includes the body of [MCP Apps] UI resources
  (`text/html;profile=mcp-app` and related content types), where the
  body literally is the rendered user interface and should respect the
  user's language.
- `LoggingMessageNotification.data` when the server's logger contract
  defines `data` (or a string field within it) as user-facing.

#### MUST NOT translate

These values are machine-interpreted; their semantics depend on the
literal string and translation would break interoperability.

- `BaseMetadata.name` on every type that extends it.
- URIs and URI templates (including `Resource.uri`, `ResourceTemplate.uriTemplate`,
  `ResourceLink.uri`, and any URI appearing in elicitation, sampling,
  or notification payloads).
- MIME types.
- JSON Schema property *keys*. Only the `title` and `description`
  *values* inside a schema are eligible for translation.
- Enum token values (the string the schema lists in `enum` or `const`),
  capability identifiers, error `code` values, method names, and
  `_meta` keys.

## Specification

This entire mechanism is **opt-in on both sides**. Clients **MAY** send
`acceptLanguage`; servers **MAY** ignore it entirely. The rules below
apply only when each side chooses to participate. Nothing in this SEP
requires any existing client or server to change behavior.

### `_meta` fields

Two extension-prefixed `_meta` keys are defined, using the
`io.modelcontextprotocol/` vendor prefix per [SEP-2133]:

| Field                                     | Direction | Type     | Required | Description                                                                                                               |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------- | -------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `io.modelcontextprotocol/acceptLanguage`  | Request   | `string` | No       | A language-range list with the syntax of the HTTP `Accept-Language` field as defined in [RFC 9110 §12.5.4].               |
| `io.modelcontextprotocol/contentLanguage` | Response  | `string` | No       | A single [BCP 47] language tag (or comma-separated list, per [RFC 9110 §8.5]) indicating the language(s) of the response. |

#### `acceptLanguage` (request)

- The client **MAY** include `io.modelcontextprotocol/acceptLanguage` in
  `params._meta` on **any** request or notification it sends.
- The value **MUST** conform to the `Accept-Language` ABNF in
  [RFC 9110 §12.5.4], i.e. a comma-separated list of language ranges per
  [RFC 4647], each with an optional weight (`q`-value).
- Examples:

  ```text
  en
  en-US
  en-US,en;q=0.9,fr;q=0.5
  *
  ```

- A server **MAY** ignore the field entirely. No capability negotiation or
  advertisement is required to opt out.
- A server that chooses to participate **MAY** select a language using
  [RFC 4647] language-range matching (lookup or filtering, server's
  choice) and produce user-facing strings in that language. It **MAY**
  additionally translate body content from `tools/call`,
  `resources/read`, and `prompts/get` (see
  [Scope](#scope-user-facing-content-and-beyond)).
- Servers **MUST NOT** translate identifiers, tool names, URIs, schema field
  names, enum tokens, MIME types, or any other value whose semantics depend
  on the literal string.
- If no available language matches the client's preferences, the server
  **SHOULD** fall back to a server-defined default and **MUST NOT** return an
  error solely because of an unmatched preference.

#### `contentLanguage` (response)

- A server that selected a language in response to `acceptLanguage`, or that
  is aware of the language of the user-facing content it returned, **MUST**
  include `io.modelcontextprotocol/contentLanguage` in `result._meta` on a
  successful response, or in `error.data._meta` on an error response (see
  [Error responses](#error-responses) below).
- The value **MUST** be a [BCP 47] language tag, or a comma-separated list
  per [RFC 9110 §8.5] when content contains multiple languages.
- A server that did not localize content **MAY** omit the field. Omission
  carries no semantics; clients **SHOULD NOT** assume any particular
  language.
- Clients **MAY** use this value for UI affordances (e.g. a "translated by
  server" badge, a fallback notice, or to drive a per-turn locale switch in
  surrounding chrome).

#### Per-request, by design

`acceptLanguage` is **not** negotiated once at the start of a session and is
**not** part of any handshake. Every request stands alone, matching the
stateless-by-default model of [SEP-2575]. This means:

- A user may change their preferred language mid-conversation; the very next
  request will reflect the change.
- Servers **MUST NOT** require that all requests within a logical session use
  the same language preference.
- Servers **MUST NOT** cache or persist a client's language preference across
  requests in a way that overrides a later, differing `acceptLanguage`
  value. Caching the resolved translations themselves is, of course, fine.

### Streamable HTTP transport binding

On Streamable HTTP, language preference and selection are also exchanged
via the standard `Accept-Language` and `Content-Language` headers, under
the same payload/header agreement rule [SEP-2243] established for
`Mcp-Method` and `Mcp-Name`. The server-side rule is relaxed in one
direction only: a missing header is tolerated (CDNs strip it), but a
present-and-disagreeing header is rejected.

#### Request

| HTTP header       | Source field                                      |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `Accept-Language` | `_meta['io.modelcontextprotocol/acceptLanguage']` |

- **Client.** When `_meta['io.modelcontextprotocol/acceptLanguage']` is
  present on a request, the client **MUST** also set the HTTP
  `Accept-Language` header on the corresponding POST to the
  **byte-identical** value.
- **Server, `_meta` present, header absent.** The server **MUST NOT**
  reject solely because `Accept-Language` is missing; it reads the
  preference from `_meta`.
- **Server, header present, `_meta` absent.** The server **MUST NOT**
  treat a bare `Accept-Language` header as an MCP language preference.
  `_meta` is the only canonical carrier across transports; without it,
  the server proceeds as though no preference was supplied.
- **Server, both present, byte-mismatch.** The server **MUST** reject
  the request with HTTP `400 Bad Request` and JSON-RPC error code
  `HeaderMismatch` in the MCP-reserved range (`-32000` to `-32099`).
  The comparison is a literal byte-equality check on the field-value
  as received: servers **MUST NOT** apply RFC 9110 / RFC 4647
  normalization for this purpose.
- **Provisional error code.** This SEP cites `-32005` for
  `HeaderMismatch`, pending the schema-level reservation work in
  [SEP-2243], [SEP-2678], and [PR #2642]; this SEP will adopt whatever
  code that work assigns. See
  [Rationale](#why--32005-rather-than--32001) for why `-32001` (the
  value originally proposed by SEP-2243) is unsuitable.

#### Response

| HTTP header        | Source field                                       |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `Content-Language` | `_meta['io.modelcontextprotocol/contentLanguage']` |

- **Server (JSON responses).** When the response (success or error)
  carries `_meta['io.modelcontextprotocol/contentLanguage']`, the
  server **MUST** set the HTTP `Content-Language` response header to
  the **byte-identical** value, and **MUST** set
  `Vary: Accept-Language` on any cacheable response whose body depends
  on the negotiated language ([RFC 9111]).
- **Server (SSE responses).** Because HTTP response headers are
  flushed before the response body is known, `Content-Language`
  **MAY** be omitted on `text/event-stream` responses; per-event
  `_meta['io.modelcontextprotocol/contentLanguage']` is the sole
  carrier in that case. Per-event variation within a single response
  is **NOT** permitted; use a fresh request to switch language
  mid-stream.
- **Client.** If a JSON response carries both `Content-Language` and
  `_meta['io.modelcontextprotocol/contentLanguage']` and they are not
  byte-identical, the client **MUST** treat the response as malformed.

#### Error responses

The standard JSON-RPC `Error` object is `{ code, message, data? }` and
carries no `_meta` of its own. Localized error content lives under
`error.data._meta`:

```jsonc
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "error": {
    "code": -32602,
    "message": "Invalid arguments",
    "data": {
      "_meta": {
        "io.modelcontextprotocol/contentLanguage": "fr-CA",
      },
      "localizedMessage": "Arguments invalides : « location » est requis.",
    },
  },
}
```

- When a server localizes the `error.message` text or any
  human-readable field inside `error.data`, it **MUST** set
  `error.data._meta['io.modelcontextprotocol/contentLanguage']` to the
  language of that text.
- The HTTP `Content-Language` response header **MUST** mirror this
  value byte-identically on JSON error responses, exactly as for
  successful responses.
- This SEP introduces no new error field beyond `_meta`; servers
  remain free to use any other `error.data` shape they already use
  for structured error context.

#### Normalization footgun and intermediary configuration

The byte-equality requirement above means operators **MUST** ensure
that no intermediary on the request or response path rewrites
`Accept-Language` or `Content-Language` while leaving the body
untouched. Concretely:

- [Fastly's `accept.language_lookup()` VCL][fastly-accept-language-lookup]
  and [Varnish's `vmod_accept`][varnish-vmod-accept] rewrite
  `Accept-Language` to a single negotiated tag before it reaches the
  origin. Under this SEP, that rewrite causes every request carrying
  `_meta[acceptLanguage]` to be rejected with `HeaderMismatch`.
  Operators using these features for per-language caching **MUST**
  carry the negotiated tag in a separate, MCP-unrelated header (e.g.
  `X-Lang`) and leave `Accept-Language` either verbatim or removed.
- [CloudFront strips `Accept-Language`][cloudfront-accept-language]
  from forwarded requests by default. This is **acceptable**: the
  server-side rule above tolerates header absence and reads `_meta`.
  Operators who want the header to reach the origin must add it to
  their origin-request policy.
- Reverse proxies that re-serialize `Accept-Language` (sorting ranges,
  normalizing whitespace, canonicalizing `q` values) will also trip
  the rule. They **MUST** preserve the header verbatim or remove it.

### stdio (and other non-HTTP) transports

Non-HTTP transports use the `_meta` fields only; there is no header layer.
All other semantics, per-request scope, fallback behavior, response
echoing, apply identically. This is the point: the same client and server
code can implement i18n once and have it work everywhere.

### Schema (illustrative)

```ts
// Request (any RequestParams)
interface RequestParams {
  _meta?: {
    /**
     * Language preference for user-facing content in the response.
     * Syntax matches the HTTP Accept-Language field (RFC 9110 §12.5.4),
     * a comma-separated list of BCP 47 language ranges with optional
     * quality values.
     *
     * @example "en-US,en;q=0.9,fr;q=0.5"
     */
    "io.modelcontextprotocol/acceptLanguage"?: string;
    [key: string]: unknown;
  };
  [key: string]: unknown;
}

// Response (any Result)
interface Result {
  _meta?: {
    /**
     * Language(s) of user-facing content in this response.
     * A BCP 47 language tag, or a comma-separated list per
     * RFC 9110 §8.5 when content contains multiple languages.
     *
     * @example "en-US"
     */
    "io.modelcontextprotocol/contentLanguage"?: string;
    [key: string]: unknown;
  };
  [key: string]: unknown;
}
```

### Examples

#### Example 1, Streamable HTTP, `tools/call`

Request:

```http
POST /mcp HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
Accept-Language: fr-CA,fr;q=0.9,en;q=0.5
Mcp-Method: tools/call
Mcp-Name: get_weather

{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "get_weather",
    "arguments": { "location": "Montréal, QC" },
    "_meta": {
      "io.modelcontextprotocol/acceptLanguage": "fr-CA,fr;q=0.9,en;q=0.5"
    }
  }
}
```

Response:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Language: fr-CA

{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "content": [
      { "type": "text", "text": "À Montréal : 4 °C, partiellement nuageux." }
    ],
    "_meta": {
      "io.modelcontextprotocol/contentLanguage": "fr-CA"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Example 2, stdio, mid-conversation language switch

```jsonc
// Turn 1: user is browsing in English
{ "jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 7, "method": "tools/list",
  "params": { "_meta": { "io.modelcontextprotocol/acceptLanguage": "en" } } }

// Turn 2 (same process, same client/server pair): user switched UI to German
{ "jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 8, "method": "tools/list",
  "params": { "_meta": { "io.modelcontextprotocol/acceptLanguage": "de-DE,de;q=0.9,en;q=0.5" } } }
```

A compliant server returns German `title`/`description` strings on turn 8
even though turn 7 was in English. No re-`initialize`, no session
invalidation.

## Rationale

### Why `_meta` and not top-level `params`

[SEP-414] established `params._meta` as the conventional location for
per-request metadata that is orthogonal to the request's primary purpose.
Language preference is exactly that kind of cross-cutting concern: it
applies uniformly to every method that may return user-facing content,
without changing any method's contract. Using `_meta` also avoids touching
the schema of every individual request type.

### Why mirror the HTTP `Accept-Language` syntax verbatim

A simple single-tag `locale` field (e.g. `"en-US"`) is more compact, but
loses the fallback chain and quality values that real
internationalization requires (e.g. "I prefer Catalan, but Spanish is fine,
and English is a last resort"). Adopting the HTTP syntax verbatim means:

- Server authors can hand the string to any RFC 4647 matcher unchanged.
- HTTP-fronted servers do not need to translate between two formats.
- The ecosystem's deep tooling for language tags applies immediately.

The cost is a slightly less obvious format for callers who only want one
language, but `"en-US"` is itself a valid `Accept-Language` value, so the
simple case stays simple.

### Why mirror to HTTP headers (with a strict byte-match rule)

Mirroring `_meta[acceptLanguage]` and `_meta[contentLanguage]` into the
standard HTTP `Accept-Language` and `Content-Language` headers lets
caches and CDNs (`Vary: Accept-Language`), edge i18n services, and
observability tools work without parsing the JSON-RPC body.

For those benefits to be sound, intermediaries must be able to rely on
the header agreeing with the payload that the origin executes on; the
security/correctness argument [SEP-2243] makes for `Mcp-Method` /
`Mcp-Name` is the same one that applies here, so this SEP extends
SEP-2243's payload/header agreement rule rather than weakening it.

Two design choices follow from extending that rule to a first-class
HTTP header rather than an MCP-specific one:

1. **Servers tolerate header absence.** [CloudFront's default
   behaviour][cloudfront-accept-language] strips `Accept-Language`
   from forwarded requests. Rejecting on absence would force every
   operator behind such a CDN to reconfigure it before deploying MCP;
   tolerating absence preserves the routing guarantee for callers who
   do supply the header, and falls back to `_meta` cleanly otherwise.
   `_meta` is the canonical transport-agnostic carrier in any case,
   since it is the only one stdio has.
2. **The comparison is byte-equality, not semantic.** [RFC 9110][rfc9110]
   does not define a single canonical serialization for
   `Accept-Language`: optional whitespace after commas
   ([§5.6.1.1][rfc9110-5.6.1.1]), case-insensitive language tags
   ([RFC 5646 §2.1.1][rfc5646-2.1.1]), `q` parameter normalization
   and trailing-zero weights ([§12.4.2][rfc9110-12.4.2]), and list
   fields legally split across field lines and recombined
   ([§5.2-5.3][rfc9110-5.2]) all admit multiple wire forms for the
   same value. A semantic-equality rule would require every
   conformant SDK to ship the same parsing and normalization step,
   which is itself a conformance hazard. Byte-equality is
   unambiguous and trivial to verify.

The cost of the byte-match rule is the
[normalization footgun](#normalization-footgun-and-intermediary-configuration):
operators using header-rewriting CDN features for per-language caching
must reconfigure them to leave `Accept-Language` either verbatim or
absent.

### Why `-32005` rather than `-32001`

[SEP-2243] originally proposed `-32001` for `HeaderMismatch`. A survey
of existing SDK implementations shows that `-32001` is already in
local use for `REQUEST_TIMEOUT` in the [Python][python-sdk-jsonrpc]
and [Kotlin][kotlin-sdk-jsonrpc] SDKs (and historically in the
TypeScript SDK), conflicting with the `HeaderMismatch` semantics used
by the [Go][go-sdk-shared] and [C#][csharp-sdk-mcperror] SDKs. To
avoid baking the conflict into a Standards-Track SEP, this SEP cites
`-32005` instead. The exact number is provisional pending the
schema-level reservation work in [SEP-2243], [SEP-2678], and
[PR #2642]; this SEP will adopt whatever code that work assigns,
and SDKs that already emit a different code for `HeaderMismatch`
should plan to migrate.

### Why per-request, not per-session

[SEP-2575] is explicit that MCP is moving to a stateless-by-default model
and that `initialize` will no longer carry persistent negotiated state.
Putting language preference in `initialize` would re-introduce exactly the
kind of session coupling that SEP-2575 removes. Per-request scope is also
genuinely useful: a user switching their UI language, or an agent
operating across users (e.g. an org-wide assistant), should be able to
change the request language without tearing anything down.

### Relationship to SEP-1809 (proposed subsumption)

[SEP-1809] proposes a `clientContext` object on `tools/call` carrying
`timezone`, `currentTimestamp`, `locale`, and `userLocation`. Its `locale`
field overlaps with this SEP. Because SEP-1809 is currently in Draft and
without a visible sponsor, and because language is a strictly cross-cutting
concern (not limited to `tools/call`), this SEP proposes to **subsume the
language aspect of SEP-1809**.

### Alternatives considered

1. **HTTP-only guidance (the original PR #2355).** Simpler, but leaves
   stdio without an answer and creates two i18n stories. Rejected per
   maintainer feedback and SEP-2575's transport-consistency requirement.
2. **A single `locale` string in `_meta`.** Simpler, but loses fallback
   semantics. Rejected, the marginal complexity of accepting the full
   `Accept-Language` syntax is paid once by spec readers and saved
   thereafter.
3. **A top-level `params.acceptLanguage` field on each affected request
   type.** Would require touching every request schema and offers no
   benefit over `_meta`. Rejected.
4. **Putting language in `initialize` capabilities.** Directly contradicts
   SEP-2575. Rejected.
5. **A new `i18n` capability that gates the feature.** Unnecessary: the
   `_meta` field is optional in both directions and degrades cleanly. No
   capability negotiation needed.

## Backward Compatibility

This proposal is fully backward compatible.

- The new `_meta` fields are optional in both directions. Servers and
  clients that do not implement them are unaffected; the field is
  ignored and the server returns content in its default language.
- On HTTP, the mirrored headers (`Accept-Language`, `Content-Language`)
  are already standard HTTP and already permitted by every existing
  framework; their presence does not break any current MCP server.
- The byte-match rule applies only when `_meta` and the corresponding
  HTTP header are both present on the same message, so a client that
  does not include `_meta[acceptLanguage]` is not required to send
  `Accept-Language`. Existing deployments that intentionally rewrite
  `Accept-Language` need a one-time configuration change before they
  can serve requests carrying `_meta[acceptLanguage]`; see
  [Normalization footgun and intermediary configuration](#normalization-footgun-and-intermediary-configuration).

## Security Implications

- **Information leakage.** `Accept-Language` is a known fingerprinting
  vector. Clients that care about user privacy **SHOULD** consider
  truncating to a coarse language (e.g. `en` rather than `en-US`) or
  omitting the field entirely. This is the same guidance the HTTP
  community already gives.
- **Injection.** Servers **MUST** validate the field against the
  `Accept-Language` ABNF before passing it to any matcher; malformed
  values should be ignored, not cause an error.
- **Cache poisoning.** Forgetting `Vary: Accept-Language` on a
  localized response is a known cache-poisoning vector; the
  normative requirement lives in
  [Streamable HTTP transport binding > Response](#response).
- **Header tampering by intermediaries** that rewrite `Accept-Language`
  or `Content-Language` causes byte-mismatch rejections under the rule
  in [Streamable HTTP transport binding](#streamable-http-transport-binding).
  This is by design (the routing guarantee from [SEP-2243] depends on
  payload/header agreement), not an attack. Operator configuration to
  avoid lockout is covered in
  [Normalization footgun and intermediary configuration](#normalization-footgun-and-intermediary-configuration).

## Reference Implementation

A reference implementation against the TypeScript SDK,
[modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk#2158] (draft), exercises every
normative rule in this SEP across both Streamable HTTP and stdio,
with an example server and client and a full test matrix.

Earlier reference for the i18n machinery itself exists in
[github-mcp-server PR #25] (a server-side translations framework),
which can be plugged into the per-request selection defined here.

## Conformance

Per [SEP-2484], a conformance scenario is required before this SEP can
reach Final. The scenario will cover, at minimum:

1. A client sending `io.modelcontextprotocol/acceptLanguage` in
   `params._meta` and (on HTTP) the byte-identical mirrored
   `Accept-Language` header.
2. A server returning localized user-facing strings and emitting
   `io.modelcontextprotocol/contentLanguage` in `result._meta` and (on
   HTTP, JSON responses) the byte-identical mirrored `Content-Language`
   response header.
3. A server falling back to its default language when no preference
   matches, without returning an error.
4. A localized error response carrying
   `error.data._meta['io.modelcontextprotocol/contentLanguage']`,
   with `Content-Language` byte-mirrored on HTTP JSON responses.
5. Per-request language switching on the same connection (notably
   stdio), to demonstrate that no session state is involved.
6. A request where the HTTP `Accept-Language` header has been stripped
   by an intermediary (e.g. CloudFront default behaviour) while `_meta`
   is preserved: the server **MUST** honor `_meta` and **MUST NOT**
   reject on this basis. Symmetrically, on the response path, a server
   **MAY** emit `_meta[contentLanguage]` without a `Content-Language`
   header on SSE streams (where headers are flushed before the body is
   known).
7. A request where the HTTP `Accept-Language` header is present and is
   not byte-identical to `_meta['io.modelcontextprotocol/acceptLanguage']`:
   the server **MUST** reject with HTTP `400 Bad Request` and the
   HeaderMismatch JSON-RPC error code (provisional `-32005`, see
   Specification). Symmetrically, on the response path, a JSON response
   carrying both `Content-Language` and `_meta[contentLanguage]` whose
   values are not byte-identical: the client **MUST** treat the
   response as malformed.

## Open Questions

1. **Notifications carrying `contentLanguage`.** Server-to-client
   notifications such as `logging/message` may contain user-facing
   text. **Proposed resolution:** the same rule applies, a notification
   that carries localized text **MUST** include
   `params._meta['io.modelcontextprotocol/contentLanguage']`. (No HTTP
   header counterpart is involved because notifications travel
   in-band on existing transports, including SSE event streams.)
