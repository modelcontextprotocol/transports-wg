## Abstract

This SEP defines a transport-agnostic mechanism for clients to express a
language preference on individual MCP requests, and for servers to indicate
the selected language in negotiated responses. Preferences are carried in
`_meta` using a single field whose value is an [RFC 4647] language-range list
with the exact syntax of the HTTP
[`Accept-Language`][rfc9110-accept-language] field (including quality values).
For the Streamable HTTP transport, the request and response values are
additionally mirrored into the standard `Accept-Language` and
`Content-Language` HTTP headers, following the precedent set by [SEP-2243] for
`Mcp-Method` and `Mcp-Name`. The proposal is deliberately narrow: it
standardizes only language negotiation, reuses an existing IETF mechanism
unchanged, and avoids any session state. Because the preference is sent per
request, a user may change it at any point during a conversation without
renegotiation, aligning with the stateless-by-default direction established by
[SEP-2575].

## Motivation

MCP exposes natural-language strings on tools, resources, prompts, and
server metadata (`title`, `description`, `text` content blocks, error
messages, etc.). Some are intended for display in user interfaces, while
others are model-facing or returned content. The specification today
provides no mechanism for a client to request these strings in a
particular language, or for a server that supports multiple languages to
indicate which language it selected. This forces ad-hoc solutions and
discourages MCP servers from investing in i18n at all.

Some use cases require more than translating UI chrome. A government
documentation server for Northern Ireland might expose a stable machine name
such as `get_document`, give the tool a localized human-readable title, and
return an official document in English, Irish, or Ulster Scots on demand. An
EU public-sector server may similarly need to return the requested official
language edition rather than rely on the model to translate an English source.
Where exact legal or administrative wording matters, model-generated
translation is not an equivalent substitute.

Other servers need mixed-language output. A web-search tool might preserve
quoted result text verbatim while localizing framing text such as "here are
the results" and its own summary. Likewise, keeping model-facing tool
descriptions in a canonical language may avoid changing agent behavior.
Meanings and cultural context do not map one-to-one between languages, model
training data is not distributed evenly, and the impact varies by model. MCP
servers may already return content in any language or mixture of languages,
so this SEP does not prescribe one content policy. It establishes a
recommended floor for clearly user-facing UI fields while leaving server
authors and their upstream content providers flexibility over model-facing
descriptions and returned content.

### Primary goal: leverage existing ecosystem; do not reinvent the wheel

The single most important design constraint for this SEP is that MCP **must
not** invent new i18n machinery. Language negotiation is one of the
oldest, most thoroughly-solved problems on the web, and the solutions are
already in the hands of every server author:

- **Standards already exist**, [BCP 47] language tags, [RFC 4647]
  language-range matching (lookup and filtering), and the HTTP
  [`Accept-Language`][rfc9110-accept-language] /
  [`Content-Language`](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc9110.html#field.content-language)
  fields are stable, widely-understood IETF specifications. No bespoke
  syntax, matching rules, or fallback semantics need to be defined here.
- **Libraries already exist**, mature parsing and matching tools are
  available across major ecosystems: `@formatjs/intl-localematcher` and
  `Negotiator` in JavaScript, `golang.org/x/text/language`, Python
  `Babel` and `langcodes`, Java/ICU `ULocale.acceptLanguage`, Ruby's
  `Rack::Utils.q_values`, and .NET's Request Localization middleware.
  Server authors can reuse these building blocks instead of re-inventing
  language matching logic.
- **Infrastructure already exists**, CDNs, caches, reverse proxies, WAFs
  and observability tools already understand `Accept-Language`,
  `Content-Language`, and `Vary: Accept-Language`. Mirroring the field
  into the HTTP layer lets an MCP server fronted by Cloudflare, Fastly,
  nginx, Envoy or an API gateway use existing configuration primitives
  for per-language caching, routing, and segmentation without parsing
  MCP-specific metadata at the edge.
- **Translation tooling already exists**, gettext catalogs, ICU
  MessageFormat, Fluent, Crowdin/Lokalise/Transifex pipelines, and every
  framework-level i18n module (Rails I18n, ASP.NET resx, Django
  `gettext`, `i18next`, etc.) already map locale identifiers and
  language tags to translation catalogues. A server can plug its
  existing translation pipeline into MCP without inventing another
  localization system.

A previous attempt to address this ([PR #2355]) proposed adding guidance to
the Streamable HTTP transport recommending the use of standard HTTP
`Accept-Language` / `Content-Language` headers. That approach was correct in
spirit but received reasonable pushback from maintainers ([@pja-ant],
[@kurtisvg]) on two grounds:

1. **Transport parity.** A header-only solution leaves stdio (and any future
   non-HTTP transport) without an i18n mechanism, fragmenting the developer
   experience. [SEP-2575] explicitly requires that "stateless principles are
   applied consistently across all transports … allowing the core protocol
   semantics to be learned once and applied everywhere."
2. **Established mirroring pattern.** [SEP-2243] has since established the
   pattern of mirroring routing-relevant fields between the JSON-RPC payload
   and HTTP headers (with strict consistency requirements). Language
   preference belongs to the same category: it is metadata that
   intermediaries (CDNs, caches, gateways), the transport, and the
   application all benefit from seeing.

This SEP resolves both concerns by defining the language preference as a
first-class, transport-agnostic field in `_meta` and, on HTTP, requiring it
to mirror the existing standard headers, gaining stdio support, header
visibility, and stateless per-turn re-negotiation in one move, while
preserving the "lean into HTTP for what it already does well" approach that
has guided MCP's authorization story.

### Scope: which fields are eligible for translation

The mechanism itself is entirely optional (see the note at the start of
[Specification](#specification)). When a server **does** choose to honor
`acceptLanguage`, the rules below define which fields it should, may, or
must not translate. The classification follows the schema's own framing of
each field: where a doc-comment says "intended for UI" or "human-readable
title", the field is display-only; where it says "hint to the model" or
"improve the LLM's understanding", the field is model-facing.

#### SHOULD translate

These fields are classified by the schema as display-only. A server
honoring `acceptLanguage` **SHOULD** localize them when a localized form
is available.

- `BaseMetadata.title` on every type that extends it: `Tool`, `Resource`,
  `ResourceTemplate`, `Prompt`, `PromptArgument`, `Implementation`,
  `PromptReference`.
- `ToolAnnotations.title`.
- `ElicitRequestFormParams.message` and `ElicitRequestURLParams.message`.
- In `ElicitRequestFormParams.requestedSchema`, the `title` and
  `description` of each property. Elicitation schemas are rendered as
  forms in the client; the model does not consume them.
- `ProgressNotification.message`.
- `error.message` in `JSONRPCError` when intended for user display (see
  [Error responses](#error-responses) for how to opt in).

#### MAY translate, with explicit caveat

These fields are either explicitly model-facing in the schema or
dual-purpose (model and human). Servers **MAY** translate them, but doing
so changes what the language model sees and can affect tool-selection,
planning, and other agent behavior. Real agent implementations wire
these fields directly into the model prompt:
for example, the open-source Codex agent passes `Tool.description`
unmodified into the OpenAI Responses API tool definition, and includes
both `title` and `description` in its tool-search index. Servers
**SHOULD** ensure translations preserve the technical meaning faithfully,
and **SHOULD** test agent behavior against translated catalogues.

- `Tool.description`, `Resource.description`,
  `ResourceTemplate.description`. The schema explicitly describes these
  as a "hint to the model".
- `Prompt.description`, `PromptArgument.description`,
  `Implementation.description`. The schema describes these as
  human-readable context; in practice hosts surface them to both users
  and models.
- Property-level `title` and `description` inside `Tool.inputSchema` and
  `Tool.outputSchema`. These appear inside the function definition the
  model receives via standard function-calling APIs, and some hosts also
  render them in parameter-confirmation UIs.
- Body content of `tools/call`, `resources/read`, and `prompts/get`.
  This includes the body of [MCP Apps] UI resources
  (`text/html;profile=mcp-app` and related content types), where the
  body literally is the rendered user interface and should respect the
  user's language.
- `LoggingMessageNotification.data` when the server's logger contract
  defines `data` (or a string field within it) as user-facing.

#### MUST NOT translate

These values are machine-interpreted; their semantics depend on the
literal string and translation would break interoperability.

- `BaseMetadata.name` on every type that extends it.
- URIs and URI templates (including `Resource.uri`, `ResourceTemplate.uriTemplate`,
  `ResourceLink.uri`, and any URI appearing in elicitation, sampling,
  or notification payloads).
- MIME types.
- JSON Schema property *keys*. Only the `title` and `description`
  *values* inside a schema are eligible for translation.
- Enum token values (the string the schema lists in `enum` or `const`),
  capability identifiers, error `code` values, method names, and
  `_meta` keys.

## Specification

This entire mechanism is **opt-in on both sides**. Clients **MAY** send
`acceptLanguage`; servers **MAY** ignore it entirely. The rules below
apply only when each side chooses to participate. Nothing in this SEP
requires any existing client or server to change behavior.

### `_meta` fields

Two extension-prefixed `_meta` keys are defined, using the
`io.modelcontextprotocol/` vendor prefix per [SEP-2133]:

| Field                                     | Direction | Type     | Required | Description                                                                                                               |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------- | -------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `io.modelcontextprotocol/acceptLanguage`  | Request   | `string` | No       | A language-range list with the syntax of the HTTP `Accept-Language` field as defined in [RFC 9110 §12.5.4].               |
| `io.modelcontextprotocol/contentLanguage` | Response  | `string` | No       | One or more [BCP 47] language tags, per [RFC 9110 §8.5], indicating the natural language(s) of the response's intended audience. |

#### `acceptLanguage` (request)

- The client **MAY** include `io.modelcontextprotocol/acceptLanguage` in
  `params._meta` on **any** request or notification it sends.
- The value **MUST** conform to the `Accept-Language` ABNF in
  [RFC 9110 §12.5.4], i.e. a comma-separated list of language ranges per
  [RFC 4647], each with an optional weight (`q`-value).
- Examples:

  ```text
  en
  en-US
  en-US,en;q=0.9,fr;q=0.5
  *
  ```

- A server **MAY** ignore the field entirely. No capability negotiation or
  advertisement is required to opt out.
- A server that chooses to participate **MAY** select a language using
  [RFC 4647] language-range matching (lookup or filtering, server's
  choice) and produce user-facing strings in that language. The set of
  fields a server may translate, and the consequences of translating
  model-facing fields, are defined in
  [Scope](#scope-which-fields-are-eligible-for-translation).
- If no available language matches the client's preferences, the server
  **SHOULD** fall back to a server-defined default and **MUST NOT** return an
  error solely because of an unmatched preference.

#### `contentLanguage` (response)

- A server that selected a language in response to `acceptLanguage` **MUST**
  include `io.modelcontextprotocol/contentLanguage` in `result._meta` on a
  successful response, or in `error.data._meta` on an error response (see
  [Error responses](#error-responses) below).
- The value **MUST** follow the `Content-Language` field-value syntax in
  [RFC 9110 §8.5]: one or more [BCP 47] language tags identifying the
  natural language(s) of the intended audience. This need not enumerate
  every language appearing in quoted or otherwise embedded content.
- A server that did not select a language in response to `acceptLanguage`
  **MAY** omit the field. Omission carries no semantics; clients **SHOULD
  NOT** assume any particular language.
- Clients **MAY** use this value for UI affordances (e.g. a "translated by
  server" badge, a fallback notice, or to drive a per-turn locale switch in
  surrounding chrome).

#### Per-request, by design

`acceptLanguage` is **not** negotiated once at the start of a session and is
**not** part of any handshake. Every request stands alone, matching the
stateless-by-default model of [SEP-2575]. This means:

- A user may change their preferred language mid-conversation; the very next
  request will reflect the change.
- Servers **MUST NOT** require that all requests within a logical session use
  the same language preference.
- Servers **MUST NOT** cache or persist a client's language preference across
  requests in a way that overrides a later, differing `acceptLanguage`
  value. Caching the resolved translations themselves is, of course, fine.

### Streamable HTTP transport binding

On Streamable HTTP, language preference and selection are also exchanged
via the standard `Accept-Language` and `Content-Language` headers, under
the same payload/header agreement rule [SEP-2243] established for
`Mcp-Method` and `Mcp-Name`. The server-side rule is relaxed in one
direction only: a missing header is tolerated (CDNs strip it), but a
present-and-disagreeing header is rejected.

For this agreement rule, implementations **MUST** remove leading and
trailing optional whitespace (OWS) from both values and then compare the
remaining strings exactly. Repeated HTTP field lines are combined per
[RFC 9110 §5.2] before comparison. Implementations **MUST NOT** apply
further semantic normalization: internal whitespace, language-tag
casing, list order, and `q`-value serialization remain significant.

#### Request

| HTTP header       | Source field                                      |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `Accept-Language` | `_meta['io.modelcontextprotocol/acceptLanguage']` |

- **Client.** When `_meta['io.modelcontextprotocol/acceptLanguage']` is
  present on a request, the client **MUST** also set the HTTP
  `Accept-Language` header on the corresponding POST to the same value.
- **Server, `_meta` present, header absent.** The server **MUST NOT**
  reject solely because `Accept-Language` is missing; it reads the
  preference from `_meta`.
- **Server, header present, `_meta` absent.** The server **MUST NOT**
  treat a bare `Accept-Language` header as an MCP language preference.
  `_meta` is the only canonical carrier across transports; without it,
  the server proceeds as though no preference was supplied.
- **Server, both present, exact mismatch.** The server **MUST** reject
  the request with HTTP `400 Bad Request` and JSON-RPC error code
  `HeaderMismatch` (`-32020`).
  The comparison uses the exact-match rule above.
- **Error code allocation.** `-32020` is the settled `HeaderMismatch`
  code in [SEP-2243] and the current MCP schema, as assigned by the
  merged error-code allocation policy in [PR #2907].

#### Response

| HTTP header        | Source field                                       |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `Content-Language` | `_meta['io.modelcontextprotocol/contentLanguage']` |

- **Server (JSON responses).** When the response (success or error)
  carries `_meta['io.modelcontextprotocol/contentLanguage']`, the
  server **MUST** set the HTTP `Content-Language` response header to
  the same value, and **MUST** set `Vary: Accept-Language` on any
  cacheable response whose body depends on the negotiated language
  ([RFC 9110 §12.5.5], [RFC 9111 §4.1]).
- **Server (SSE responses).** Because HTTP response headers are
  flushed before the response body is known, `Content-Language`
  **MAY** be omitted on `text/event-stream` responses; per-event
  `_meta['io.modelcontextprotocol/contentLanguage']` is the sole
  carrier in that case. Per-event variation within a single response
  is **NOT** permitted; use a fresh request to switch language
  mid-stream.
- **Client.** If a JSON response carries both `Content-Language` and
  `_meta['io.modelcontextprotocol/contentLanguage']` and they do not
  satisfy the exact-match rule above, the client **MUST** treat the
  response as malformed.

#### Error responses

The standard JSON-RPC `Error` object is `{ code, message, data? }` and
carries no `_meta` of its own. The standard JSON-RPC `error.code`
remains the machine-interpreted identifier; `error.message` is the
human-readable display string. When a server localizes an error after
selecting a language in response to `acceptLanguage`, it **MUST**
translate `error.message` directly and **MUST** carry the language tag
in `error.data._meta`:

```jsonc
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "error": {
    "code": -32602,
    "message": "Arguments invalides : « location » est requis.",
    "data": {
      "_meta": {
        "io.modelcontextprotocol/contentLanguage": "fr-CA",
      },
    },
  },
}
```

- When a server selects a language in response to `acceptLanguage` and
  localizes `error.message` (or any human-readable field it places
  inside `error.data`), it **MUST** set
  `error.data._meta['io.modelcontextprotocol/contentLanguage']` to
  the language of that text.
- The HTTP `Content-Language` response header **MUST** mirror this value
  under the exact-match rule on JSON error responses, exactly as for
  successful responses.
- Clients **MUST NOT** branch on the text of `error.message`; per
  JSON-RPC 2.0, programmatic dispatch is on `error.code`. This SEP
  treats `code` as the identifier and `message` as a display string,
  consistent with the [Scope](#scope-which-fields-are-eligible-for-translation)
  rule that identifiers are not translated but display strings are.
- This SEP introduces no new error field beyond `_meta`; servers
  remain free to use any other `error.data` shape they already use
  for structured error context.

#### Notifications

The same rule applies to server-to-client notifications that carry
user-facing text (for example `logging/message` or `notifications/progress`
where the `message` is rendered to the user). When such a notification
carries localized text, the server **MUST** include
`io.modelcontextprotocol/contentLanguage` in `params._meta`. No HTTP
header counterpart applies, since notifications travel in-band on the
existing transport (including SSE event streams).

#### Normalization footgun and intermediary configuration

The exact-match requirement above means operators **MUST** ensure
that no intermediary on the request or response path rewrites
`Accept-Language` or `Content-Language` while leaving the body
untouched. Concretely:

- [Fastly's `accept.language_lookup()` VCL][fastly-accept-language-lookup]
  and [Varnish Enterprise's `vmod_accept`][varnish-vmod-accept] rewrite
  `Accept-Language` to a single negotiated tag before it reaches the
  origin. Under this SEP, that rewrite causes every request carrying
  `_meta[acceptLanguage]` to be rejected with `HeaderMismatch`.
  Operators using these features for per-language caching **MUST**
  carry the negotiated tag in a separate, MCP-unrelated header (e.g.
  `X-Lang`) and leave `Accept-Language` either verbatim or removed.
- [CloudFront strips `Accept-Language`][cloudfront-accept-language]
  from forwarded requests by default. This is **acceptable**: the
  server-side rule above tolerates header absence and reads `_meta`.
  Operators who want the header to reach the origin must add it to
  their origin-request policy.
- Reverse proxies that re-serialize `Accept-Language` (sorting ranges,
  normalizing whitespace, canonicalizing `q` values) will also trip
  the rule. They **MUST** preserve the header verbatim or remove it.

### stdio (and other non-HTTP) transports

Non-HTTP transports use the `_meta` fields only; there is no header layer.
All other semantics, per-request scope, fallback behavior, response
echoing, apply identically. This is the point: the same client and server
code can implement i18n once and have it work everywhere.

### Schema (illustrative)

```ts
// Request (any RequestParams)
interface RequestParams {
  _meta?: {
    /**
     * Language preference for user-facing content in the response.
     * Syntax matches the HTTP Accept-Language field (RFC 9110 §12.5.4),
     * a comma-separated list of BCP 47 language ranges with optional
     * quality values.
     *
     * @example "en-US,en;q=0.9,fr;q=0.5"
     */
    "io.modelcontextprotocol/acceptLanguage"?: string;
    [key: string]: unknown;
  };
  [key: string]: unknown;
}

// Response (any Result)
interface Result {
  _meta?: {
    /**
     * Natural language(s) of this response's intended audience.
     * One or more BCP 47 language tags identifying the natural
     * language(s) of the intended audience, per RFC 9110 §8.5.
     *
     * @example "en-US"
     */
    "io.modelcontextprotocol/contentLanguage"?: string;
    [key: string]: unknown;
  };
  [key: string]: unknown;
}
```

### Examples

#### Example 1, Streamable HTTP, `tools/call`

Request:

```http
POST /mcp HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
Accept-Language: fr-CA,fr;q=0.9,en;q=0.5
Mcp-Method: tools/call
Mcp-Name: get_weather

{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "get_weather",
    "arguments": { "location": "Montréal, QC" },
    "_meta": {
      "io.modelcontextprotocol/acceptLanguage": "fr-CA,fr;q=0.9,en;q=0.5"
    }
  }
}
```

Response:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Language: fr-CA

{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "content": [
      { "type": "text", "text": "À Montréal : 4 °C, partiellement nuageux." }
    ],
    "_meta": {
      "io.modelcontextprotocol/contentLanguage": "fr-CA"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Example 2, stdio, mid-conversation language switch

```jsonc
// Turn 1: user is browsing in English
{ "jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 7, "method": "tools/list",
  "params": { "_meta": { "io.modelcontextprotocol/acceptLanguage": "en" } } }

// Turn 2 (same process, same client/server pair): user switched UI to German
{ "jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 8, "method": "tools/list",
  "params": { "_meta": { "io.modelcontextprotocol/acceptLanguage": "de-DE,de;q=0.9,en;q=0.5" } } }
```

In this example, the server returns German `title` and `description`
strings on turn 8 even though turn 7 was in English. No re-`initialize`,
no session invalidation.

## Rationale

### Why `_meta` and not top-level `params`

The base protocol's [`_meta` field][MCP _meta] is the conventional
location for metadata that is orthogonal to a request's primary purpose.
Language preference is exactly that kind of cross-cutting concern: it
applies uniformly to every method that may return user-facing content,
without changing any method's contract. Using `_meta` also avoids
touching the schema of every individual request type.

### Why mirror the HTTP `Accept-Language` syntax verbatim

A simple single-tag `locale` field (e.g. `"en-US"`) is more compact, but
loses the fallback chain and quality values that real
internationalization requires (e.g. "I prefer Catalan, but Spanish is fine,
and English is a last resort"). Adopting the HTTP syntax verbatim means:

- Server authors can use a standard `Accept-Language` parser and
  RFC 4647 matcher without defining another wire syntax.
- HTTP-fronted servers do not need to translate between two formats.
- The ecosystem's deep tooling for language tags applies immediately.

The cost is a slightly less obvious format for callers who only want one
language, but `"en-US"` is itself a valid `Accept-Language` value, so the
simple case stays simple.

### Why mirror to HTTP headers (with a strict exact-match rule)

Mirroring `_meta[acceptLanguage]` and `_meta[contentLanguage]` into the
standard HTTP `Accept-Language` and `Content-Language` headers lets
caches and CDNs (`Vary: Accept-Language`), edge i18n services, and
observability tools work without parsing the JSON-RPC body.

For those benefits to be sound, intermediaries must be able to rely on
the header agreeing with the payload that the origin executes on; the
security/correctness argument [SEP-2243] makes for `Mcp-Method` /
`Mcp-Name` is the same one that applies here, so this SEP extends
SEP-2243's payload/header agreement rule rather than weakening it.

Two design choices follow from extending that rule to a first-class
HTTP header rather than an MCP-specific one:

1. **Servers tolerate header absence.** [CloudFront's default
   behaviour][cloudfront-accept-language] strips `Accept-Language`
   from forwarded requests. Rejecting on absence would force every
   operator behind such a CDN to reconfigure it before deploying MCP;
   tolerating absence preserves the routing guarantee for callers who
   do supply the header, and falls back to `_meta` cleanly otherwise.
   `_meta` is the canonical transport-agnostic carrier in any case,
   since it is the only one stdio has.
2. **The comparison is exact, not semantic.** [RFC 9110][rfc9110]
   does not define a single canonical serialization for
   `Accept-Language`: optional whitespace after commas
   ([§5.6.1.1][rfc9110-5.6.1.1]), case-insensitive language tags
   ([RFC 5646 §2.1.1][rfc5646-2.1.1]), and `q` parameter normalization
   and trailing-zero weights ([§12.4.2][rfc9110-12.4.2]) all admit
   multiple serializations for the same semantics. Repeated field
   lines are first combined using the standard processing in
   [RFC 9110 §5.2], and leading and trailing OWS is ignored, matching
   [SEP-2243]. Beyond that transport-level processing, a semantic
   equality rule would require every conformant SDK to ship the same
   language parsing and normalization step, which is itself a
   conformance hazard. Exact string equality is unambiguous and
   trivial to verify.

The cost of the exact-match rule is the
[normalization footgun](#normalization-footgun-and-intermediary-configuration):
operators using header-rewriting CDN features for per-language caching
must reconfigure them to leave `Accept-Language` either verbatim or
absent.

### Why `-32020`

The merged allocation policy in [PR #2907] leaves `-32000` through
`-32019` implementation-defined and reserves `-32020` through
`-32099` for specification-defined MCP errors. It assigns the first
code in that range, `-32020`, to `HeaderMismatch`. [SEP-2243] and the
current MCP schema now use that settled value, so this SEP does too.

### Why per-request, not per-session

[SEP-2575] removes the `initialize` handshake and makes MCP
stateless-by-default. Putting language preference in a handshake would
re-introduce exactly the kind of session coupling that SEP-2575 removes.
Per-request scope is also genuinely useful: a user switching their UI
language, or an agent operating across users (e.g. an org-wide
assistant), should be able to change the request language without
tearing anything down.

### Relationship to SEP-1809 (proposed subsumption)

[SEP-1809] proposed a `clientContext` object on `tools/call` carrying
`timezone`, `currentTimestamp`, `locale`, and `userLocation`. Its
`locale` field overlaps with this SEP. The issue was closed when the SEP
workflow moved to pull requests, without the proposal being accepted or
rejected. If it is resubmitted, this SEP proposes to **subsume the
language aspect of SEP-1809**, because language is a strictly
cross-cutting concern rather than one limited to `tools/call`.

### Alternatives considered

1. **HTTP-only guidance (the original PR #2355).** Simpler, but leaves
   stdio without an answer and creates two i18n stories. Rejected per
   maintainer feedback and SEP-2575's transport-consistency requirement.
2. **A single `locale` string in `_meta`.** Simpler, but loses fallback
   semantics. Rejected, the marginal complexity of accepting the full
   `Accept-Language` syntax is paid once by spec readers and saved
   thereafter.
3. **A top-level `params.acceptLanguage` field on each affected request
   type.** Would require touching every request schema and offers no
   benefit over `_meta`. Rejected.
4. **Putting language in `initialize` capabilities.** Directly contradicts
   SEP-2575. Rejected.
5. **A new `i18n` capability that gates the feature.** Unnecessary: the
   `_meta` field is optional in both directions and degrades cleanly. No
   capability negotiation needed.

## Backward Compatibility

This proposal is fully backward compatible.

- The new `_meta` fields are optional in both directions. Servers and
  clients that do not implement them are unaffected; the field is
  ignored and the server returns content in its default language.
- On HTTP, the mirrored headers (`Accept-Language`, `Content-Language`)
  are already standard HTTP and already permitted by every existing
  framework; their presence does not break any current MCP server.
- The exact-match rule applies only when `_meta` and the corresponding
  HTTP header are both present on the same message, so a client that
  does not include `_meta[acceptLanguage]` is not required to send
  `Accept-Language`. Existing deployments that intentionally rewrite
  `Accept-Language` need a one-time configuration change before they
  can serve requests carrying `_meta[acceptLanguage]`; see
  [Normalization footgun and intermediary configuration](#normalization-footgun-and-intermediary-configuration).

## Security Implications

- **Information leakage.** `Accept-Language` is a known fingerprinting
  vector. Clients that care about user privacy **SHOULD** consider
  truncating to a coarse language (e.g. `en` rather than `en-US`) or
  omitting the field entirely, consistent with the privacy guidance in
  [RFC 9110 §12.5.4].
- **Injection.** Servers **MUST** validate the field against the
  `Accept-Language` ABNF before passing it to any matcher. A malformed
  value **SHOULD** be treated as absent rather than causing an error.
- **Cache poisoning.** Forgetting `Vary: Accept-Language` on a
  localized response is a known cache-poisoning vector; the
  normative requirement lives in
  [Streamable HTTP transport binding > Response](#response).
- **Header tampering by intermediaries** that rewrite `Accept-Language`
  or `Content-Language` causes exact-match rejections under the rule
  in [Streamable HTTP transport binding](#streamable-http-transport-binding).
  This is by design (the routing guarantee from [SEP-2243] depends on
  payload/header agreement), not an attack. Operator configuration to
  avoid lockout is covered in
  [Normalization footgun and intermediary configuration](#normalization-footgun-and-intermediary-configuration).

## Reference Implementation

A reference implementation against the TypeScript SDK,
[modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk#2158] (draft), is intended to
exercise the normative rules in this SEP across both Streamable HTTP
and stdio, with an example server, an example client, and a full test
matrix.
[github-mcp-server PR #25] provides earlier prior art for the
server-side translations machinery that plugs into the per-request
selection defined here.

## Conformance

Per [SEP-2484], a conformance scenario is required before this SEP can
reach Final. The scenario will cover, at minimum:

1. A client sending `io.modelcontextprotocol/acceptLanguage` in
   `params._meta` and (on HTTP) an `Accept-Language` header that
   satisfies the exact-match rule.
2. A server selecting a language in response to `acceptLanguage`,
   returning localized user-facing strings, and emitting
   `io.modelcontextprotocol/contentLanguage` in `result._meta` and (on
   HTTP, JSON responses) a `Content-Language` response header that
   satisfies the exact-match rule.
3. A server falling back to its default language when no preference
   matches, without returning an error.
4. A localized error response carrying
   `error.data._meta['io.modelcontextprotocol/contentLanguage']`,
   with a `Content-Language` header satisfying the exact-match rule on
   HTTP JSON responses.
5. Per-request language switching on the same connection (notably
   stdio), to demonstrate that no session state is involved.
6. A request where the HTTP `Accept-Language` header has been stripped
   by an intermediary (e.g. CloudFront default behaviour) while `_meta`
   is preserved: a participating server **MUST** honor `_meta` and
   **MUST NOT** reject on this basis. Symmetrically, on the response
   path, a server
   **MAY** emit `_meta[contentLanguage]` without a `Content-Language`
   header on SSE streams (where headers are flushed before the body is
   known).
7. A request where the HTTP `Accept-Language` header is present and is
   not an exact match for `_meta['io.modelcontextprotocol/acceptLanguage']`:
   the server **MUST** reject with HTTP `400 Bad Request` and the
   `HeaderMismatch` JSON-RPC error code (`-32020`). Symmetrically, on
   the response path, a JSON response
   carrying both `Content-Language` and `_meta[contentLanguage]` whose
   values are not an exact match: the client **MUST** treat the
   response as malformed.
