# SEP-XXXX: Restrict Sampling & Elicitation to Client Request Scope

## Status
**Proposed**

## Summary

This SEP clarifies that `sampling/createMessage` and `elicitation/create` requests **MUST** be sent only in association with an originating client request (e.g., during `tools/call`, `resources/read`, or `prompts/get` processing). Standalone server-initiated sampling or elicitation on independent communication streams are not supported and **SHOULD NOT** be implemented.

## Motivation

### Current Ambiguity

The current specification uses **SHOULD** language in the transport layer:

> "The server **MAY** send JSON-RPC _requests_ and _notifications_ before sending the JSON-RPC _response_. These messages **SHOULD** relate to the originating client _request_."

This creates ambiguity about whether servers can initiate sampling/elicitation requests:
- On standalone SSE streams (HTTP GET without prior client request)
- Independent of any client operation
- As "push" notifications to request user input or LLM completions

### Design Intent

The design intent of both sampling and elicitation has always been to operate **nested within** other MCP operations:

- **Sampling** enables servers to request LLM assistance while processing a tool call, resource request, or prompt
- **Elicitation** enables servers to gather additional user input needed to complete an operation
- Both are **reactive** capabilities, not proactive push mechanisms

The current specification already describes this pattern:

> "Sampling in MCP allows servers to implement agentic behaviors, by enabling LLM calls to occur _nested_ inside other MCP server features."

However, the normative requirements don't enforce this constraint.

### Simplification Benefits

Making this constraint explicit:

1. **Simplifies transport implementations** - Transports don't need to support arbitrary server-initiated request/response flows; they only need request-scoped bidirectional communication
2. **Clarifies user experience** - Users understand that sampling/elicitation happens *because* they initiated an action, not spontaneously
3. **Reduces security surface** - Ensures client has context for what scope the additional requested information  will be used for. This allows clients to make better informed decisions on whether to provide the requested info. 
4. **Aligns with practice** - Most (likely all) existing implementations already follow this pattern

## Specification Changes

### 1. Add Warning Blocks to Feature Documentation

**In `client/sampling.mdx` (after existing security warning):**

```markdown
<Warning>

**Request Association Requirement**

Servers **MUST** send `sampling/createMessage` requests only in association with an originating client request (e.g., during `tools/call`, `resources/read`, or `prompts/get` processing).

Standalone server-initiated sampling on independent communication streams (unrelated to any client request) is not supported and **MUST NOT** be implemented. Future transport implementations are not required to support this pattern.

</Warning>
```

**In `client/elicitation.mdx` (after existing security warning):**

```markdown
<Warning>

**Request Association Requirement**

Servers **MUST** send `elicitation/create` requests only in association with an originating client request (e.g., during `tools/call`, `resources/read`, or `prompts/get` processing).

Standalone server-initiated elicitation on independent communication streams (unrelated to any client request) is not supported and **MUST NOT** be implemented. Future transport implementations are not required to support this pattern.

</Warning>
```

### 2. Clarify Transport Layer Constraints

**In `basic/transports.mdx`, POST-initiated SSE streams (line ~121):**

```diff
- The server **MAY** send JSON-RPC _requests_ and _notifications_ before sending the
- JSON-RPC _response_. These messages **SHOULD** relate to the originating client
- _request_.
+ The server **MAY** send JSON-RPC _requests_ and _notifications_ before sending the
+ JSON-RPC _response_. These messages **SHOULD** relate to the originating client
+ _request_. In particular, `sampling/createMessage` and `elicitation/create` 
+ requests **MUST** only be sent in this context (associated with a client request).
```

**In `basic/transports.mdx`, GET-initiated standalone SSE streams (line ~147):**

```diff
- The server **MAY** send JSON-RPC _requests_ and _notifications_ on the stream.
- These messages **SHOULD** be unrelated to any concurrently-running JSON-RPC
- _request_ from the client.
+ The server **MAY** send JSON-RPC _requests_ and _notifications_ on the stream.
+ These messages **SHOULD** be unrelated to any concurrently-running JSON-RPC
+ _request_ from the client, **except** that `sampling/createMessage` and 
+ `elicitation/create` requests **MUST NOT** be sent on standalone streams.
```

## Backward Compatibility

### Impact Assessment

This change is expected to have **minimal to no impact** on existing implementations:

1. **Common usage patterns are preserved** - Sampling/elicitation within tool execution, resource reading, and prompt handling remain fully supported
2. **No known implementations affected** - Research conducted on GitHub has shown only one implementation of this pattern. This singular implementation is owned by the SEP author. 
3. **stdio transport unaffected** - The stdio transport already operates in a request-scoped manner where all server messages naturally associate with client operations. 

**TODO** 

### What's Disallowed

The following pattern, which was never explicitly documented or recommended, is now explicitly prohibited:

```python
# ❌ PROHIBITED: Standalone server push
async def background_task():
    while True:
        await asyncio.sleep(60)
        # Try to initiate sampling without any client request context
        await session.create_message(...)  # NOT ALLOWED
```

### What Remains Supported

The canonical pattern remains fully supported:

```python
# ✅ SUPPORTED: Sampling during tool execution
@mcp.tool()
async def analyze_data(data: str, ctx: Context) -> str:
    # Request LLM analysis while processing the tool call
    result = await ctx.session.create_message(
        messages=[SamplingMessage(role="user", content=...)]
    )
    return result.content.text
```

## Implementation Guidance

### For Server Implementers

**No changes required** if your server:
- Only uses sampling/elicitation within tool handlers
- Only uses sampling/elicitation within resource/prompt handlers  
- Uses sampling/elicitation synchronously as part of processing a client request

**Changes required** if your server:
- Attempts to initiate sampling/elicitation on standalone HTTP GET streams
- Attempts to send sampling/elicitation requests independent of client operations
- Has background tasks that try to invoke sampling/elicitation

Alternative designs will need to be implemented for the "Changes Required" case.

### For Client Implementers

**No changes required** - Clients should already handle sampling/elicitation requests in the context of their own outbound requests. Potential to simplify implementations if out-of-band supported.

### For Transport Implementers

Future transport implementations can rely on the guarantee that:
- Sampling/elicitation requests only occur within the scope of a client-initiated request
- Transports don't need to support arbitrary server-initiated request/response flows on standalone channels
- Request correlation and lifecycle management is simplified

## Timeline

(This SEP intends to serve as a public notice of the change prior to future protocol versions that will not be compatible with this usage)

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Soft Deprecation
Use **SHOULD NOT** language to discourage but not prohibit the pattern.

**Rejected because:** The behavior was never intentionally supported, and leaving it ambiguous prevents transport simplification.

### 2. Keep Current Ambiguity
Leave the existing **SHOULD** language unchanged.

**Rejected because:** This blocks future transport implementations and leaves implementers uncertain about whether the pattern is supported.

### 3. Create a Capability Flag
Add a `sampling.standalone` or similar capability for servers that want this behavior.

**Rejected because:** This adds complexity for a use case with no known demand, and contradicts the "nested" design principle.
