# 2026-02-18 Transports WG (Weekly)

## TL;DR
The meeting focused on core maintainer feedback for in-flight Specification
Enhancement Proposals (SEPs) and refining the Multi-Round Trip Request (MRTR)
proposal. PR 2260 (deprecating unsolicited server requests) is expected to pass,
while PR 2243 (HTTP Headers) requires revisions to optimize header usage and
generalize custom parameters. The bulk of the session centered on MRTR,
particularly addressing SDK maintainer concerns regarding backwards
compatibility and breaking changes. The group debated using capabilities versus
protocol versioning to gracefully migrate clients to the new stateless flow.
Technical clarifications were made regarding the use of Tasks for MRTR, handling
race conditions idempotently, and generalizing the MRTR pattern beyond just tool
calls. The group reached an 80-90% consensus to advance MRTR to a formal SEP,
pending a few wording updates and a final review next week. Peter Alexander will
also engage the Python and TypeScript SDK teams to ensure smooth architectural
alignment.

## Detailed Summary

### Core Maintainer PR Updates
* **PR 2260 (Out-of-Context Elicitation):** Caitie McCaffrey reported that the
  SEP to eliminate unsolicited server out-of-context elicitation and sampling is
  expected to pass the official core maintainer vote with only minor comments to
  address.
* **PR 2243 (HTTP Standardization):** Core maintainers requested more time to
  review this SEP and provided three main points of feedback:
    1. **Header Optimization:** Can multiple headers be combined, or can headers
       like tool names be reused for methods/resources?
    2. **Custom Parameters:** Suggestion to generalize the custom parameter
       mirroring to cover *any* field in the MCP body via a key-value map,
       rather than restricting it to tool parameters. 
    3. **Encoding Prior Art:** Requests for prior art or examples regarding the
       encoding strategy. Mike Kistler and Kurtis Van Gent will work on these
       revisions.

### MRTR: Backwards Compatibility & SDK Impact
* **Breaking Changes:** Peter Alexander relayed significant concerns from SDK
  maintainers about the MRTR proposal breaking existing client code. 
* **Capabilities vs. Versioning:** The group debated how to handle the
  migration. Mark Roth suggested leveraging protocol versioning to eventually
  deprecate the old flow. Simon Russell and Stephen Halter advocated for
  capability-based negotiation so clients can opt into the new MRTR flow,
  allowing servers to choose their implementation while clients support both
  during the transition. 
* **Migration Plan:** Caitie McCaffrey emphasized that a clear socialization and
  migration plan (potentially involving a migration bot) must accompany the SEP
  to help developers transition before the old flow is officially deprecated.

### MRTR: Technical Clarifications
* **Generalizing the Pattern:** Mike Kistler pointed out that the document
  leaned too heavily on tool calls. Mark Roth agreed to update the wording to
  clarify that the MRTR pattern applies to *any* client-initiated request (e.g.,
  resources with templates), framed as a split between ephemeral/stateless
  patterns and persistent/stateful patterns.
* **Progress Notifications:** Clarified that in the ephemeral flow, a server can
  still send progress notifications via the SSE stream *before* it sends the
  elicitation request (incomplete result) and closes the stream.
* **Encryption Examples:** Kurtis Van Gent requested clarification on encryption
  requirements. Mark Roth confirmed that AESGCM and assigned JWTs are merely
  illustrative examples, not mandatory requirements; servers can use other
  encryption methods.
* **Load Shedding:** Simon Russell highlighted a buried feature: a server can
  send an incomplete response with request state but *no* input requests, purely
  for load shedding (asking the client to resume later). Mark Roth will make
  this feature more prominent in the SEP.

### MRTR: Tasks and Race Conditions
* **New Task Method:** A new API method was introduced for clients to send input
  requests back to tasks. Luca Chang and Caitie McCaffrey explained that
  separating this from the `tasks/get` (status) call ensures consistent
  performance and better database observability for the status endpoint.
* **Handling Input Race Conditions:** Kurtis Van Gent asked how the protocol
  handles multiple clients/threads submitting conflicting inputs to the same
  task. Mark Roth and Caitie McCaffrey argued against adding complex "declined"
  error states. Instead, the server should process inputs idempotently (e.g.,
  taking the first valid submission). If an input is invalid, the task simply
  remains in the "input required" state.

## Action Items
- [ ] **Mark Roth** to update the MRTR SEP wording to generalize the pattern
  beyond tool calls.
- [ ] **Mark Roth** to clarify in the MRTR SEP that AESGCM and JWT are just
  examples of encryption, not requirements.
- [ ] **Mark Roth** to explicitly add the new method for sending input requests
  to tasks to the list of methods in the SEP.
- [ ] **Mark Roth** to elevate the visibility of the "load shedding" feature
  (incomplete response with state but no input request) within the document.
- [ ] **Mark Roth** to complete all document changes before next week's meeting
  for a final review.
- [ ] **Peter Alexander** to meet with the Python and TypeScript SDK maintainers
  to discuss the MRTR proposal and architectural impacts.
- [ ] **Caitie McCaffrey & Group** to begin working on the necessary schema
  changes to formally convert the MRTR document into a proper SEP.
