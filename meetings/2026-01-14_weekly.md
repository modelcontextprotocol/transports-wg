# 2026-01-14 Transports WG (Weekly)

## TL;DR
The group reviewed positive progress on SDK alignment, confirming a
cross-language agreement on bindings. A GitHub repository has been established
to document outcomes and manage weekly notes via Pull Requests. The group
outlined a timeline targeting a final proposal vote by the end of March.
Significant discussion focused on the HTTP standardization proposal,
specifically the use of standard and custom headers to improve routing
compatibility with existing infrastructure like load balancers. Debates centered
on security implications, header limits, and the trade-offs between client-side
complexity and server-side scalability. Microsoft offered to serve as a test
party for the multi-roundtrip request track to address current pain points with
SSE and elicitation.

## Detailed Summary

### Roadmap and Process
* **SDK Alignment:** Kryspin Ziemski reported a positive connection with Felix,
  confirming alignment on cross-SDK and cross-language bindings. The team will
  collaborate on uniform documentation.
* **Documentation:** Peter established a GitHub repository containing
  folders for docs and proposals. The group agreed to use this repo for
  documenting outcomes and managing meeting notes via PRs to allow for community
  review.
* **Timeline:** A project timeline was outlined:
    * End of January: Initial proposal to core contributors.
    * End of February: Reference implementation to validate the proposal in at
      least one language.
    * End of March: Finalize proposal for an official vote and acceptance into
      the specification.
* **Track Management:** A table was created to check in on the status of various
  tracks. The TypeScript SDK was designated as the "proving ground" for
  prototyping and design work.

### Technical Decisions: HTTP Standardization
* **Header Proposal:** The group discussed a "straw man" proposal to standardize
  HTTP headers (e.g., `MCP-Method`, `MCP-Tool-Name`) to expose critical routing
  information. The goal is to allow networking proxies and load balancers to
  route requests without parsing the entire JSON RPC payload.
* **Custom Headers:** A mechanism was proposed to mirror specific tool
  parameters into sanitized headers (`X-MCP-Param-Name`) to support routing
  logic, such as regional database requests.
* **Security Concerns:** Participants debated potential risks, including "poison
  pill" attacks where malicious servers could demand an infinite number of
  headers to exhaust client resources. There was strong advocacy for
  comprehensive conformance tests and potentially establishing reasonable limits
  on required headers.
* **Routing Alternatives:** The group compared header-based routing against
  path-based routing and query parameters. While path-based routing matches some
  existing framework patterns (e.g., Flask), headers were preferred for avoiding
  payload "cracking" at load balancers. Query parameters were dismissed due to
  lack of support in gRPC.
* **Schema Definition:** Discussion occurred regarding where header extraction
  metadata should live. While the tool description schema is the natural place
  for parameter properties, some argued for a separate section to keep the
  schema focused solely on data definition.

### Multi-Roundtrip Request Track
* **Stateless Protocol:** Clarification was provided that discovery cards fall
  under the "stateless protocol" track, while changes to elicitations and
  sampling belong to the "multi-roundtrip request" track.
* **Synergy with Tasks:** It was noted that the tasks workstream overlaps with
  multi-roundtrip requests, offering an opportunity to simplify task workflows
  using a stateless approach.
* **Testing:** Caitie McCaffrey offered Microsoft as a test party for this track
  due to real-world challenges with Server-Sent Events (SSE) and elicitation.

## Action Items
- [ ] All track leads/participants to write a brief status summary in the track
  check-in table.
- [ ] Kurtis Van Gent to consolidate feedback on the HTTP standardization
  proposal and work with Mike to upload a version to GitHub for further comment.
- [ ] Mark Roth to prepare a presentation for the "multi-roundtrip request"
  track for next week's meeting.
