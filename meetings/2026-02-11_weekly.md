# 2026-02-11 Transports WG (Weekly)

## TL;DR
The meeting, facilitated by Mark Roth, focused on reviewing three in-flight
Specification Enhancement Proposals (SEPs) to prepare them for the core
maintainers. The group approved Shaun Smith's SEP to disallow unsolicited
server-to-client requests, pending a clear definition of "associated" requests.
Mike Kistler's HTTP Standardization SEP was also approved with modifications,
specifically making schema validation optional for custom parameters on
intermediate servers. Lastly, Luca Chang's Task Progress SEP faced pushback
regarding the deprecation of SSE progress notifications; the group agreed to
amend the SEP to add progress capabilities to tasks without removing the
existing SSE mechanism, but will review the revised proposal again next week
before advancing it.

## Detailed Summary

### Process & General Updates
* **Facilitation:** Mark Roth facilitated the meeting as Kurtis Van Gent was
  driving. 
* **Agent Contexts:** Kryspin Ziemski briefly shared concepts for agents
  utilizing dynamic resources and stateful code modes to predict cause and
  effect.
* **MRTR Next Steps:** Mark Roth will meet with Caitie McCaffrey and Gabriel
  Zimmerman on Friday to resolve open questions on the Multi-Round Trip Request
  (MRTR) proposal.

### Technical Decisions: Sampling & Elicitation SEP
* **Scope & Ambiguity:** Shaun Smith presented an SEP to clarify that
  server-initiated requests (like sampling and elicitation) cannot be
  unsolicited. Mike Kistler clarified that this applies to *all*
  server-initiated requests, not just sampling and elicitation.
* **Defining Association:** Debate arose over how to associate server requests
  with client requests, especially for the standard IO transport. The group
  agreed to explicitly define "associated" in the SEP, meaning the server
  request must supply a matching JSON RPC request ID from the client.
* **Decision:** The SEP was approved with changes to advance to the core
  maintainers. Shaun Smith will update the wording and coordinate with Mike
  Kistler.

### Technical Decisions: HTTP Standardization SEP
* **Validation Requirements:** Mike Kistler's SEP regarding HTTP headers was
  reviewed. The primary debate focused on whether intermediate servers (like
  load balancers) cracking the payload must validate custom headers against
  schemas they might not have access to.
* **Decision:** The group agreed that if a server modifies or processes the
  payload, it must validate standard parameters. However, validating custom
  parameters is optional if the server lacks the schema; it can simply pass them
  along. The SEP was approved with these changes, and Kurtis Van Gent agreed to
  sponsor it.

### Technical Decisions: Task Progress SEP
* **Deprecating SSE:** Luca Chang presented an SEP to move progress
  notifications to the Tasks API and deprecate the current SSE-based progress
  mechanism.
* **Pushback:** Significant objections came from Shaun Smith, Stephen Halter,
  and Simon Russell. They argued that removing SSE progress notifications breaks
  low-stakes, real-time use cases (e.g., multimodal inference, sub-agents,
  streaming results) where setting up a persistent Task is too heavyweight.
* **Decision:** Mark Roth proposed modifying the SEP to *only add* progress
  notifications to tasks, abandoning the removal of the old SSE mechanism for
  now. Luca agreed. Caitie McCaffrey requested to review this revised proposal
  next week before it goes to the core maintainers.

## Action Items
- [ ] **Shaun Smith** to update the Sampling/Elicitation SEP with the agreed
  definition of "associated", sync with Mike Kistler, and move the PR to the
  main repo by Friday.
- [ ] **Mike Kistler** to address comments on the HTTP Standardization PR,
  update the validation rules for custom parameters, and move the PR to the main
  repo by Friday.
- [ ] **Luca Chang** to update the Task Progress SEP by Friday to only add
  progress to tasks without removing the old SSE mechanism.
- [ ] **Group** to review Luca's updated Task Progress SEP asynchronously on
  Monday and Tuesday.
- [ ] **Mark Roth** to add the revised Task Progress SEP and the MRTR proposal
  to next week's agenda.
