# 2026-01-28 Transports WG (Weekly)

## TL;DR
The group discussed updates on the Python SDK refactoring, noting a "holding
pattern" while waiting for a PR from Google's Powan. Shaun Smith confirmed the
submission of a Specification Enhancement Proposal (SEP) to formally deprecate
unsolicited sampling and elicitation on the background channel. The primary
focus was reconciling the Multi-Round Trip Request (MRTR) proposal with the
"Tasks" mechanism. The group agreed that the "get stream" (SSE) must be optional
for core functionality like elicitation. A technical debate regarding data
structures (Map vs. Array) for server-initiated requests led to a decision to
split the work into two parallel, consistent proposals—one for the ephemeral
case (led by Mark Roth) and one for the persistent case (led by Caitie
McCaffrey)—to be reviewed after an offline sync.

## Detailed Summary

### SDKs and Process
* **Python SDK Refactoring:** Kryspin Ziemski and Mark Roth discussed the status
  of the Python SDK. The group is waiting for a Pull Request from Powan
  regarding the separation of server and runner before pushing further changes.
* **Verscell Integration:** Kryspin Ziemski asked about contacts at Verscell
  regarding their custom MCP implementation. Shaun Smith confirmed he is in
  touch with Matt Lenhard and offered to connect them offline.
* **Unsolicited Requests SEP:** Shaun Smith submitted the SEP discussed the
  previous week to formally deprecate unsolicited sampling and elicitation on
  the background "get stream."
* **Data Usage:** Shaun Smith offered to share data from "several million
  sessions" of MCP usage scraped from his server to assist with decision-making.

### Technical Decisions: MRTR and Tasks
* **Optionality of SSE Streams:** Caitie McCaffrey argued that to ensure the
  protocol works in stateless environments like Cloud Run, the "get stream"
  (SSE) must not be required for core functionality like elicitation and
  sampling. The group agreed to scope this change to elicitation/sampling first,
  deferring progress notifications.
* **Ephemeral vs. Persistent Flows:**
    * **Tool Calls (Ephemeral):** Defined as short-running, synchronous, and
      stateless. Mark Roth proposed a flow where the server returns an
      incomplete response, and the client retries with the original info plus
      the response.
    * **Tasks (Persistent):** Defined as long-running, asynchronous, and
      stateful. Caitie McCaffrey and Luca Chang clarified the "Input Required"
      state, where the client polls for a result and receives an elicitation
      request.
* **Message Structure Alignment:**
    * Mark Roth argued for using consistent message types for the "elicitation
      response" in both ephemeral and persistent cases.
    * **Map vs. Array:** A debate arose regarding the container for
      server-initiated requests. Mark Roth proposed a Map structure (key-value)
      to handle multiple parallel requests and ensure association if server
      logic changes. Caitie McCaffrey and Luca Chang pushed back, suggesting
      this introduces ambiguity and complexity, preferring arrays or reusing
      existing `ToolResult` structures.
* **Unique Keys:** The group debated the necessity of unique keys for server
  requests within a single tool call context. Mark Roth argued they are needed
  for association; Caitie McCaffrey suggested parameter names might be
  sufficient.

### Path Forward
* **Dual Proposals:** To resolve the complexity, the group decided to split the
  work into two parallel proposals that will be kept consistent:
    1.  **Ephemeral Case:** Led by Mark Roth, focusing on the stateless
        request/response flow without tasks.
    2.  **Persistent Case:** Led by Caitie McCaffrey, focusing on how Tasks
        utilize the request/response flow for stateful operations.
* **Synchronization:** Mark Roth, Caitie McCaffrey, and Luca Chang will meet
  offline to align on data structures before the next meeting.

## Action Items
- [ ] **Shaun Smith** to connect with Kryspin Ziemski offline regarding Matt
  Lenhard and Verscell.
- [ ] **Mark Roth** to update the track brief to explicitly call out the agreed
  goals (making SSE optional).
- [ ] **Mark Roth** to schedule an offline sync with Caitie McCaffrey and Luca
  Chang for Friday to resolve data structure nuances (Map vs. Array).
- [ ] **Mark Roth** to update the Ephemeral MRTR proposal to explicitly cover
  single back-and-forth, multiple back-and-forth, and multiple requests in a
  single response.
- [ ] **Caitie McCaffrey** to update the Persistent/Tasks proposal to align with
  the ephemeral definitions.
