# 2026-01-21 Transports WG (Weekly)

## TL;DR
The group reached a consensus to move forward with deprecating unsolicited
server-to-client requests (sampling and elicitations) on the "get stream" to
simplify protocol design and address security concerns. This decision was
supported by data showing negligible usage in existing repositories. Mark Roth
presented a "Multi-Roundtrip Request" proposal designed to replace the current
SSE-based elicitation flow with a stateless, request-response model where
clients echo back state. The group discussed the technical implications of this
change. Finally, the group identified a need to reconcile this new proposal with
the existing "Tasks" mechanism and will invite the Tasks author (Luca) to the
next meeting.

## Detailed Summary

### Deprecation of Unsolicited Requests
* **Proposal to Remove:** Shaun Smith proposed assuming that unsolicited
  sampling and elicitations (server-to-client requests) are removed from the
  session track. He argued that eliminating these unsolicited communications
  resolves complex state transfer issues regarding cookies and session IDs.
* **Usage Data:** Peter Alexander shared analysis results from scanning several
  thousand MCP repositories, finding only one instance of unsolicited sampling
  usage (which belonged to Shaun Smith).
* **Decision:** The group agreed to draft a Specification Enhancement Proposal
  (SEP) to formally deprecate unsolicited requests on the /GET stream.
* **Scope:** The SEP will specifically disallow servers from sending sampling or
  elicitation requests without an associated client request ID.

### Technical Decisions: Multi-Roundtrip Requests
* **Problem Statement:** Mark Roth outlined the inefficiency of the current
  elicitation flow, where a server opens an SSE stream for elicitation, forcing
  the client to make a completely independent request that must be manually
  linked back to the original context by the server.
* **Proposed Stateless Flow:** Mark presented a new pattern where the server
  immediately terminates the initial request with a response indicating "more
  information needed." The client then sends a completely new request containing
  the original information plus the elicitation response.
* **State Management (Hidden Fields vs. Cookies):**
    * The group debated how to handle state persistence between the terminated
      request and the retry.
    * Gabriel Zimmerman and Simon Russell argued against using HTTP cookies,
      suggesting a "hidden field" mechanism (opaque blob) is more appropriate
      for per-tool-call state that should not persist globally.
    * Mark Roth agreed, noting that cookies fail when multiple tool calls run in
      parallel within the same session.
* **SDK Impact:** Peter Alexander and Simon Russell acknowledged that while
  switching to this model will be painful for SDK maintainers to implement
  initially, the resulting architecture is significantly easier to maintain and
  conceptually simpler.

### Interaction with Tasks
* **Overlap Analysis:** The group identified that the "Tasks" mechanism
  currently duplicates some functionality discussed in the multi-roundtrip
  proposal, specifically regarding polling and state retention.
* **Unified Vision:** Caitie McCaffrey noted that Tasks and Tool Calls are
  similar but necessary; she described Tasks as a "promise over a network" and
  suggested that the handling of elicitation responses in both systems needs to
  align.
* **Next Steps:** The group agreed to invite Luca (author of Tasks) to the next
  meeting to deeply dive into the relationship between the new stateless
  proposal and the existing Tasks implementation.

## Action Items
