# 2026-02-25 Transports WG (Weekly)

## TL;DR
The working group agreed to advance the Multi-Roundtrip Request (MRTR)
Specification Enhancement Proposal (SEP) to the core contributors for initial
feedback, despite open questions regarding SDK backward compatibility. To manage
the SEP's complexity, the group decided to decouple a significant redesign of
the Tasks API from the current proposal. Caitie McCaffrey will formalize the
schema changes, which treat requests for more information as optional parameters
to gracefully handle client mismatches. Additionally, Shaun Smith presented an
early draft for Session management. The group discussed open design questions
regarding server identity, Key-Value store usage, and handling servers that mix
stateful and stateless tools, culminating in an action item for Shaun Smith to
draft a formal SEP detailing these specific use cases.

## Detailed Summary

### MRTR SEP: Error Handling & Mismatched Inputs
* Caitie McCaffrey submitted a PR to address error handling, proposing that
  servers treat requests for more information as optional parameters.
* If a client returns unexpected or mismatched data (e.g., returning only one of
  two requested parameters), the server should simply ignore the unexpected data
  and re-request the missing information.
* The group agreed this should be framed as guidance for tool developers rather
  than strict protocol-level error handling.
* Concerns about infinite loops from clients repeatedly sending bad data should
  be handled via standard rate limiting and throttling, not at the protocol
  level.

### MRTR SEP: Persistent Workflow & Tasks API
* Luca Chang and Mark Roth discussed simplifying the persistent workflow by
  combining task status, input responses, and final results into a single
  unified `tasks continue` RPC.
* However, to prevent the MRTR SEP from becoming overly bloated, the group
  reached a consensus to decouple this larger Tasks API redesign from the
  current MRTR proposal.
* The group will proceed with the current MRTR structures and signal to SDK
  maintainers that the Tasks API remains experimental and subject to future
  optimization.

### SEP Advancements & Core Contributor Review
* Despite concerns raised by Shaun Smith and Peter Alexander regarding SDK
  backward compatibility and the lack of a live reference implementation, the
  group voted (7 approvals, 2 abstentions) to advance the MRTR SEP to the core
  maintainers to gather early feedback.
* Caitie McCaffrey, Mark Roth, and Gabriel Zimmerman will finalize the schema
  changes by Friday to prepare for this review.
* The separate Request-Response Association SEP was confirmed as accepted, and
  Caitie McCaffrey will proceed with merging it into the main repository.

### Sessions Proposal (V2)
* Shaun Smith demonstrated a rough draft PR for session management, utilizing
  the `meta` tag for cookie data to enable features like session creation,
  resumption, and deletion.
* Open questions remain regarding server identity, the inclusion of a Key-Value
  (KV) store within the session data, and whether to include list/recover
  operations.
* Caitie McCaffrey raised a critical scoping concern regarding the complexity of
  mixing stateful (session-based) and stateless tools within a single MCP
  server, suggesting that servers should ideally operate entirely in one
  paradigm or the other.
* Kurtis Van Gent tasked Shaun Smith with drafting a concrete SEP that
  explicitly compares the approach to HTTP cookies and outlines the specific use
  cases and flows for session support.

## Action Items
- [ ] Caitie McCaffrey to format the error handling PR as guidance for tool
  developers rather than a strict protocol-level error handling mechanic.
- [ ] Caitie McCaffrey, Mark Roth, and Gabriel Zimmerman to finalize and publish
  the proper set of schema changes for the MRTR SEP by Friday.
- [ ] Caitie McCaffrey to ping Dan to confirm the merge of the Request-Response
  Association SEP.
- [ ] Kurtis Van Gent to request time in the upcoming core contributors meeting
  for the MRTR SEP, send the relevant links, and ensure Mark Roth is added to
  the invite to discuss rationale.
- [ ] Shaun Smith to draft a concrete SEP for Sessions that covers use cases, a
  comparison to HTTP cookies, and the flow/overlap for MCP servers mixing
  session and non-session support.
