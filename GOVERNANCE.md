# Transports Working Group Governance

The Transports Working Group operates under a lightweight, consensus-driven governance model aligned with the broader MCP community.

## Principles

1. **Open Participation** — Anyone can participate regardless of affiliation
2. **Transparency** — All decisions are documented and publicly accessible
3. **Consensus-Driven** — Maintainers seek agreement; objections prompt discussion
4. **Antitrust Compliance** — All activities follow the [MCP Antitrust Policy](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/blob/main/ANTITRUST.md)
5. **Ecosystem Alignment** — Work aligns with broader MCP goals and specifications

## Roles
